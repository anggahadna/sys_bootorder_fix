# Fixing : System BootLoader not found. Initializing defaults.
This is a bash script to fix "System BootOrder not found" error that works on my Linux Mint.
This script is based on [Pygrammer YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzObzq0V25A&ab_channel=Pygrammer)

If you find this problem in your computer and have the following criteria :
- Using Linux Mint or other Ubuntu's derivative distro
- This problem appears when your computer is booting then directly boot into your Linux without entering GRUB

Then I guess this method might be work for you.

> *__Disclaimer : Do with your own risk__*

## How to run
1. Download the script
2. Open your Terminal
3. Switch to root user by using `sudo su`
4. Run the script by using `sh ./fixboot.sh`. Make sure the file is in the same directory
